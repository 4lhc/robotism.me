I wanted to control my Turtlebot3 gazebo simulations using the Xiaomi MiBand HRX. MiBand uses Bluetooth Low Energy for communication. The major challenge in trying to interface the MiBand HRX with ROS, was understanding the undocumented services and characteristics. Fortunately, there are several python libraries that are written for MiBand2 & 3 models. So, I didn't have to start from scratch!

Still, the challenge of finding the right services & values remained. I started by forking [this](https://github.com/creotiv/MiBand2) wonderful library by creotiv which used bluepy. I was only interested in reading the accelerometer data.

Check out the repo [here]({{page.gh_repo}}).


So, let's begin by identifying the MAC address of the MiBand!

### 1. BLE - connecting and reading data
An excellent place to learn about BLE GATT Services and Characteristics would be [here](https://www.oreilly.com/library/view/getting-started-with/9781491900550/ch04.html).
#### Scan for available devices
```sh
sudo hcitool lescan
```


The following commands were helpful in identification of services and characteristics specific to HRX bands. Xiaomi doesn't provide user descriptions for the services and characteristics, which makes it harder. There are plenty of reverse engineered solutions for MiBand2 & 3 which are extremely [helpful](#sources--references).

#### List services
```sh
gatttool -b <MAC-ADDRESS> -t random --primary
```

#### List characteristics
```sh
gatttool -b <MAC-ADDRESS> -t random --characteristics
```


#### Auth and notifications
- Authentication is same as MiBand2
- Services & Characteristics of interest (names are arbitrary)

    - ``SERVICE_MIBAND1 : "0000fee1-0000-1000-8000-00805f9b34fb"``
        - ``CHARACTERISTIC_SENSOR_CONTROL : "00000001-0000-3512-2118-0009af100700"``
        - ``CHARACTERISTIC_SENSOR_MEASURE : "00000002-0000-3512-2118-0009af100700"``

- To receive accelerometer notification
    - Write without response ``0x010119`` to service ``0000fee1-0000-1000-8000-00805f9b34fb`` characeteristic ``00000001-0000-3512-2118-0009af100700``
    - Write without response ``0x02`` to service ``0000fee1-0000-1000-8000-00805f9b34fb`` characeteristic ``00000001-0000-3512-2118-0009af100700``
    - Write ``0x0100`` to notification descriptor to enable notification



### 2. Processing Accelerometer Data

After successfully reading the raw accelerometer data, the next step would be to make sense of it.

#### Parsing
The data is received in packets of byte size ``20``, ``14`` or ``8``.

Sample: ``0x0100 0500 8200 0b00 0400 8000 0b00 0300 8100 0b00``


|0100  | 0500  | 8200  | 0b00 | 0400  | 8000  | 0b00  | 0300  | 8100  | 0b00   |
|:-:|:-:|:-:|:-:|:-:|:-:|:-:|:-:|:-:|:-:|
| -  | signed x  |signed y   | signed z  |  signed x |  signed y | signed z  | signed x  | signed y  |  signed z |

Parsing of raw data is performed by the method ``_parse_raw_accel()``.

{% highlight python %}
def _parse_raw_accel(self, bytes):
    for i in range(int((len(bytes)-2)/6)):
        g = struct.unpack('hhh', bytes[2 + i * 6:8 + i * 6])
        try:
            self.accel_queue.put(g)
        except Full:
            self.accel_queue.get_nowait()
            self.accel_queue.put(g)
        return g
{% endhighlight %}

#### Calculating Roll and Pitch
In the absence of linear acceleration, the accelerometer output is a measurement of the rotated
gravitational field vector and can be used to determine the accelerometer pitch and roll orientation
angles. The following equations are used to calculate the roll and pitch from the 3 linear accelerations.

<div class="box">

{% raw %}
  $$tan\phi_{xyz} = \left ( \frac{G_{py}} {G_{pz}} \right )$$

  $$tan\theta_{xyz} = \left ( \frac{-G_{px}} {\sqrt{G_{py}^{2} + G_{pz}^{2}}} \right )$$
{% endraw %}

</div>


{% highlight python %}
roll = math.atan2(gy, gz)
pitch = math.atan2(-gx, math.sqrt(pow(gy, 2) + pow(gz, 2)))
{% endhighlight %}
