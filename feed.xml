Moreover, we can run ROS environments that are unsupported for our distros without having to mess with virtual machines. It is quite easy to set up a singularity container for ROS melodic. We will be using the osrf docker image from [Docker Hub]({{page.docker_link}}). Before we begin, follow the instructions [here]({{singularity_install}}) to install singularity if you haven't.



### Creating a sandbox
It is recommended to run the command below with root permissions.
```sh
sudo singularity build --sandbox melodic/ docker://osrf/ros:melodic-desktop-full
```
This will create a directory named `melodic` inside the current working directory. Once the sandbox is built, we can test it by running `roscore`.

```sh
singularity exec -p melodic/  bash -c '/ros_entrypoint.sh roscore'
```

Where `ros_entrypoint.sh` is a bash script inside the `melodic/` sandbox that sources `setup.bash` for us.


### Update and modification

Let's now proceed by updating the packages (you can also install packages that you need). For this we will use the `shell` command.
Note, that the `--writable` option is necessary to mount the container as read-write.

```sh
sudo shell --writable melodic/
```

Once we are inside the container shell, we can run `apt update` and install our packages. We can also add the update the `/root/.bashrc` to our taste. Or, ditch bash altogether and install `zsh`.

```sh
&gt; apt update
&gt; mkdir -p /root/Projects #if you want to create extra directories
```


### Binding filesystems

By default, singularity will mount the current working directory inside the container, if the directory exists inside. You can use the `--bind` option to mount host filesystems to directories inside the container. For example, the following command will start the shell and mount my host system's `/dev/sda5` to  `/root/Projects`.

```sh
sudo singularity shell --bind /dev/sda5:/root/Projects --bind /run --writable melodic/
```

In order to run gui applications, use `--bind /run`.



### Convert container format

Finally, we can create `img` file from the `sandbox` by running the following command.

```sh
sudo singularity build melodic.img melodic/
```


### Building from recipe files

The steps mentioned above can be build easily with a recipe file too.

```
#melodic-husky.def
Bootstrap: docker
From: osrf/ros:melodic-desktop-full-bionic

%help
    Singularity container with ROS melodic with husky

%labels
    Author sj@email.org
    

%post
    apt -y update
    apt -y install ros-melodic-husky-navigation \
                   ros-melodic-husky-gazebo \
                   ros-melodic-husky-viz
    bash -c &quot;source /opt/ros/melodic/setup.bash&quot;
```

Build the container with the following command

```sh
sudo singularity build melodic-husky.sif melodic-husky.def
```

We will start by setting up project ros package.

### 1. Setup
Create a package named ``x1_miband_control`` with a dependency on rospy.
{% highlight bash %}
catkin_create_pkg x1_miband_control rospy
cd x1_miband_control/src
{% endhighlight %}

We have three other runtime dependencies to make the MiBand controller work. [PyCrypto](https://github.com/dlitz/pycrypto), [bluepy](https://github.com/IanHarvey/bluepy) &amp; the [MiBand HRX](https://github.com/4lhc/MiBand_HRX) library that we created in Part I.
Once inside the ``x1_miband_control/src`` directory we can clone the dependencies. Make sure that you checkout the right versions

{% highlight bash %}
git clone -n https://github.com/4lhc/MiBand_HRX
cd MiBand_HRX
git checkout 1711a218ab66bfba25aa7de717452574301dcba5
{% endhighlight %}

Repeat the same for the other dependencies. From ``xi_miband_control/src``
{% highlight bash %}
git clone -n https://github.com/dlitz/pycrypto
cd pycrypto
git checkout 7fd528d03b5eae58eef6fd219af5d9ac9c83fa50
cd ..
git clone -n https://github.com/IanHarvey/bluepy
cd bluepy
git checkout dc33285f31a873fab92c22e8839c44899f82b041
{% endhighlight %}

Bluepy and pycrypto has to be built and installed using setup.py inside their respective directories. I am yet to find a way to automate the build of these dependencies using CmakeLists.txt. Inside both bluepy &amp; pycrypto directories run,

{% highlight bash %}
python setup.py build &amp;&amp; python setup.py install
{% endhighlight %}

Furthermore, I had to move ``xi_miband_control/src/bluepy/bluepy`` to ``xi_miband_control/src/bluepy`` inorder for bluepy to work.


Next, we will create a setup.py in out package root with the following content and uncomment the ``catkin_python_setup()`` macro in ``CmakeLists.txt`` to make sure that our dependencies get installed.

{% highlight python %}
{% github_sample /4lhc/ROS/blob/0006a7ac12131a579777117e9cc4e1e5f31f805e/learning_ws/src/x1_miband_control/setup.py %}
{% endhighlight %}
&lt;!--{% github_sample_ref /4lhc/ROS/blob/0006a7ac12131a579777117e9cc4e1e5f31f805e/learning_ws/src/x1_miband_control/setup.py %}--&gt;


Finally, run ``catkin_make`` from the catkin workspace root to build everything.


### 2. MiBand Controller

We will start by importing the necessary modules. Multithreading is used to prevent the ``band.start_raw_data_realtime()`` method from blocking.
[``generic_robot``]({{page.gh_file1}}) contains a simple ``Robot()`` class definition.


[``vel_control()``]({{page.gh_file2}}#L42) method sets the robot's linear x velocity to a value proportional to the pitch of the MiBand and the angular z velocity to a value proportional to MiBand's roll. It also applies a low pass filter to the roll &amp; pitch.

[``start_control()``]({{page.gh_file2}}#L27) will run as long as data is available from the MiBand. If the robot crashes into a wall, the method sends a vibration alert to the MiBand.

MiBand uses Bluetooth Low Energy for communication. The major challenge in trying to interface the MiBand HRX with ROS, was understanding the undocumented services and characteristics. Fortunately, there are several python libraries that are written for MiBand2 &amp; 3 models. So, I didn't have to start from scratch!

Still, the challenge of finding the right services &amp; values remained. I started by forking [this](https://github.com/creotiv/MiBand2) wonderful library by creotiv which used bluepy. I was only interested in reading the accelerometer data.

Check out the repo [here]({{page.gh_repo}}).


So, let's begin by identifying the MAC address of the MiBand!

### 1. BLE - connecting and reading data
An excellent place to learn about BLE GATT Services and Characteristics would be [here](https://www.oreilly.com/library/view/getting-started-with/9781491900550/ch04.html).
#### Scan for available devices
```sh
sudo hcitool lescan
```


The following commands were helpful in identification of services and characteristics specific to HRX bands. Xiaomi doesn't provide user descriptions for the services and characteristics, which makes it harder. There are plenty of reverse engineered solutions for MiBand2 &amp; 3 which are extremely [helpful](#sources--references).

#### List services
```sh
gatttool -b &lt;MAC-ADDRESS&gt; -t random --primary
```

#### List characteristics
```sh
gatttool -b &lt;MAC-ADDRESS&gt; -t random --characteristics
```


#### Auth and notifications
- Authentication is same as MiBand2
- Services &amp; Characteristics of interest (names are arbitrary)

    - ``SERVICE_MIBAND1 : &quot;0000fee1-0000-1000-8000-00805f9b34fb&quot;``
        - ``CHARACTERISTIC_SENSOR_CONTROL : &quot;00000001-0000-3512-2118-0009af100700&quot;``
        - ``CHARACTERISTIC_SENSOR_MEASURE : &quot;00000002-0000-3512-2118-0009af100700&quot;``

- To receive accelerometer notification
    - Write without response ``0x010119`` to service ``0000fee1-0000-1000-8000-00805f9b34fb`` characeteristic ``00000001-0000-3512-2118-0009af100700``
    - Write without response ``0x02`` to service ``0000fee1-0000-1000-8000-00805f9b34fb`` characeteristic ``00000001-0000-3512-2118-0009af100700``
    - Write ``0x0100`` to notification descriptor to enable notification



### 2. Processing Accelerometer Data

After successfully reading the raw accelerometer data, the next step would be to make sense of it.

#### Parsing
The data is received in packets of byte size ``20``, ``14`` or ``8``.

Sample: ``0x0100 0500 8200 0b00 0400 8000 0b00 0300 8100 0b00``


|0100  | 0500  | 8200  | 0b00 | 0400  | 8000  | 0b00  | 0300  | 8100  | 0b00   |
|:-:|:-:|:-:|:-:|:-:|:-:|:-:|:-:|:-:|:-:|
| -  | signed x  |signed y   | signed z  |  signed x |  signed y | signed z  | signed x  | signed y  |  signed z |

Parsing of raw data is performed by the method ``_parse_raw_accel()``.

{% highlight python %}
def _parse_raw_accel(self, bytes):
    for i in range(int((len(bytes)-2)/6)):
        g = struct.unpack('hhh', bytes[2 + i * 6:8 + i * 6])
        try:
            self.accel_queue.put(g)
        except Full:
            self.accel_queue.get_nowait()
            self.accel_queue.put(g)
        return g
{% endhighlight %}
[view on github]({{page.gh_basepy}}#L147)

#### Calculating Roll and Pitch
In the absence of linear acceleration, the accelerometer output is a measurement of the rotated
gravitational field vector and can be used to determine the accelerometer pitch and roll orientation
angles. The following equations are used to calculate the roll and pitch from the 3 linear accelerations.

&lt;div class=&quot;box&quot;&gt;

{% raw %}
  $$tan\phi_{xyz} = \left ( \frac{G_{py}} {G_{pz}} \right )$$

  $$tan\theta_{xyz} = \left ( \frac{-G_{px}} {\sqrt{G_{py}^{2} + G_{pz}^{2}}} \right )$$
{% endraw %}

&lt;/div&gt;


{% highlight python %}
roll = math.atan2(gy, gz)
pitch = math.atan2(-gx, math.sqrt(pow(gy, 2) + pow(gz, 2)))
{% endhighlight %}
[view on github]({{page.gh_basepy}}#L267)


#### Plot
